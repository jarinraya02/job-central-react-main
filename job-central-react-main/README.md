# **Job Central**

- In this project I tried to create a website similar to what typically a job hunting website looks like. Here, A person can look for available jobs, read the description of the job and then apply for the job. Also, The website can show the categories of jobs a person has applied for i.e remote or onsite by filtering all the jobs.
